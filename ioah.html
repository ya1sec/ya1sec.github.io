<p>gracies barcelonas. o what is coming.</p>
<p>i sit alone or in Pennsylvania<br>and<br>the blind sleep and do miracles<br>two little yellow butterflies<br>peck-at-my-heart<br>choice if i grow<br>not money, armors, dress, eating, erudition<br>but as i stood,<br>dream&#39;d forth a long absence<br>was joined by the beggar</p>
<p>what waits shall be good<br>and rather-<br>if i lose my breath,<br>paint no head without its friend before you,<br>holding a little charity<br>for i hear from above o pennant of war and peace<br>a little sustenance, a hut and a garden, a little innocent child by either hand,<br>the future will be measured<br>won day i shall answer to everything</p>
<p>then everyone will hear a weird creeping thing more or less as follows--<br>(other to a minde diseas&#39;d)</p>
<p>I was<br>If possible I was floating</p>
<p>down among the streamlet into drops<br>i told. i was in hand again.<br>i saw their faces<br>i realized i had risen</p>
<p>and for the Muse, i say bring yet help<br>mild aunt Liza is as much as i sit writing here,<br>sick and grown old<br>from cache or cave beyond the flow of beauty<br>and round her stares agape<br>the smoke of war:<br>the other asks if we cannot escape our likes and mislikes<br>exiles or ambu-</p>
<p>now the chorus i hear:<br>one form of the world is the sign for a body.<br>And title of that art<br>led us traverse into the moon not absolutely</p>
<p>youknow that, insofarforth as, all up to do especially, we recognise that:</p>
<p>the endorsement of all,<br>pestilence, tryanny,<br>countless years drawing themselves onward and outward,<br>nothing collapses</p>
<p>the foot of ohoho honest<br>is now<br>what i have dared to open my mouth on.<br>his burnt head high up above<br>what perfume shall i wear for the<br>theatre of infinite folly?</p>
<p>this is a godsend<br>are you a toxis.</p>
<p>at random from myself<br>twomeys, for gracious sake<br>life down through my trueblues.<br>my glueglue gluecose. peebles.<br>there&#39;s not a lot.</p>
<p>Singing, as if with the bents and skerries,<br>he had already been given all objects<br>it is obvious that we cried aloud<br>at him<br>but<br>witty as calling him by the name of space?<br>?</p>
<p>how came he by the face of the dead<br>The Gracehoper feared he would not sleepe:<br>City and State, North, South, East, West, Whence<br>do you say all?<br>Well, let&#39;s away.<br>do be devils&#39;nd play tops or kites or hoops or marbles<br>you are viry vikid if you&#39;re not achamed</p>
<p>alas you are mighty cute--<br>enough secrets and private nonsense?</p>
<p>So then he walk&#39;d<br>that remaining sage, to follow evil or good,<br>to the moon now-- and<br>i must admit-- hung between sea and sky<br>imperial magnificence of sound, and the beam, and one thing clear:<br>A proposition determines a logical form.<br>For the need of food, we must make use of this</p>
<p>them against the wind<br>but i was living.<br>however, that is all</p>
<p>lice nittle clinkers,<br>two twilling bugs and the beam<br>Funny spot to have been<br>by the heirs of age!<br>himself out, all his lards<br>I looked, and it was I heard, growing fainter and<br>the other world so near,<br>that little bungalow<br>evening was there,<br>and here it was I did my proper dimensions</p>
<p>halfway from the thought itself<br>some of our new struggles<br>i made a leap over the<br>Fundamental Laws of Arithmetic<br>mutatis mutandis<br>for maybe it would have to go<br>by the window wide</p>
<p>the top of my dismay:<br>they have waved his hand<br>how easie is it but an activity<br>simply killing, soaring<br>selfless Allself,<br>an abstract of the sun<br>these operations i call our univalse<br>and in a particular sound<br>for goodnesse dare not utter</p>
<p>fool to be curiously<br>king, and much like ants<br>god be with him<br>and cozenage of lyfe<br>if they have to say it<br>the thing i saw?<br>i honestly think,<br>if i put in the brick,<br>certain things may be possible</p>
<p>performe what you can<br>at least up twoards the point it blows from<br>imprints on it<br>and the rocks echo<br>construction of the moon<br>project therefore love itself</p>
<p>suddenly he seem&#39;d to guard it<br>for that time he used a blanket<br>a deepe damnation of his neighbors<br>the urge to move forward<br>and begge for belles to ring</p>
<p>tall creature,<br>with the sort of idea<br>leaves bones and ayleean plants<br>some way away<br>instead of smoke<br>waved his hand</p>
<p>what favors i did find<br>as he pointed his travels<br>to an illegitimate leap<br>mastered much of nothing</p>
<p>but low<br>low he rises about us<br>one by one<br>and for a time tugs gently at light</p>
<p>and me: the travelling inkhorn<br>came nearly against the ground<br>i dare say i have breath&#39;d<br>occur to you now?<br>the possibility of such a night?</p>
<p>and in a curious little thing to do<br>proof in logic must be something in common<br>if it did existe</p>
<p>since burst and dark,<br>our efforts diminished,<br>the conditions of a dusty yellow color<br>came alltoolyrical an expression<br>i can sneeze tomorrow<br>would that be he was<br>gracious at our feet</p>
<p>let us imagine there were against me<br>animal enjoyment<br>infinitely many praises<br>of my neglect<br>and merry mind you,<br>able to get this matter calmly<br>twicetook me for freedom</p>
<p>weeping to him,<br>haunt of a downfol<br>we select a new whooping laugh<br>one poor soul lays quite still</p>
<p>psychology is no other despair<br>each day a new gash<br>and years perhaps<br>pitch,<br>twisted my head and neck<br>shifting to the point where<br>mine is no longer<br>all that moves</p>
<p>right well,<br>blue lumines in any case<br>fending the disascent<br>through all that moves<br>and with those<br>faint seekings<br>turn now to understand<br>space and time,<br>a month and little feet,<br>that which makes it possible for me<br>to beg your pardon<br>put something faint in her tree<br>refuse of his ears and bedsheet and misery<br>attention failed altogether</p>
<p>moral: if you listen<br>there are martian joys<br>perhaps like variyis regular others<br>emerge at halfclock veniences<br>so too death lookes full<br>and familiar Brother Intelligence<br>leads to nothing more</p>
<p>isnt that that that what i should<br>i raise aloft<br>still the future is no time for<br>breakfast or baffled feuds</p>
<p>resting the grass and warbling birds<br>it was possible<br>then it was stopped<br>Miza says time passes blood upon<br>dreams drames or popular ends</p>
<p>Steer then with good artillery.<br>To bind another to Dr. Bull,<br>No matter what the devil dances at your side,<br>And thus I say to you, I should be led.<br>He rapped out the darkness</p>
<p>and if the big wheel,<br>lull&#39;d and late,<br>nothing of the new world:<br>the wide-breath&#39;d games<br>these stormy gusts and winds with me,<br>alas a dot in his mind<br>florida as it beam&#39;d on you gray-brown bird</p>

<p>yet quench&#39;d by an angel mild:<br>after he had leapt<br>grey hairs were on him<br>some to him the look of a bomb.</p>
<p>but now, looking at us,<br>the wars and wild events came forward<br>and it is impossible to represent<br>this simple matter<br>in any language<br>it is safe<br>i have tried it<br>and in all directions<br>o love<br>solve all</p>
